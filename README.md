## Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of ~1,200 records containing sales information from 2020–2025 across multiple U.S. states.  
The goal is to identify:

- Which product categories drive revenue and volume  
- Which payment methods generate the highest profit  
- How sales vary across regions  
- How monthly/seasonal patterns affect performance

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicates and checked for missing values  
- Converted **Amount**, **Profit**, and **Quantity** to numeric types  
- Converted **Order Date** to proper date format  
- Retained hierarchical fields:  
  - Category → Sub-Category  
  - State → City  
- Ensured consistency for PivotTable analysis

- **Office Supplies** → Highest sales volume (~209K units)  
- **Electronics & Furniture** → Highest revenue generators (~$2M+ each)  
- Balanced strategy needed between high-volume and high-value products  

### **2. Profit by Payment Method**
- **Debit Card** → ~25% of total profit  
- **COD & EMI** → ~18% each  
- Digital payments (UPI/Credit) underused → opportunity for promotions  

### **3. Regional Insights**
- **California & New York** → Strongest performing states  
- **Illinois** → Lowest performance  
- Electronics dominate in high-demand regions  

### **4. Monthly & Seasonal Trends**

  - **June–July**  
  - **October–December**  
- Early months (Jan–Mar) show lower activity → ideal for promotions
